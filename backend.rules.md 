# Lumenalta Backend MVP — Rules (always on for this folder)

Context
- Build a tiny REST API for a To-Do app using Node + Express.
- Save data to a small JSON file on disk (no database).

Role
- Act as a senior backend pair. Work in small diffs. Explain briefly.

Action
- Create endpoints:
  - GET /tasks  → newest first
  - POST /tasks { title } → trim, reject empty, return full Task
  - PATCH /tasks/:id/toggle → flip completed
  - DELETE /tasks/:id → remove
- Add minimal validation and clear 4xx/5xx messages.
- Turn on CORS for http://localhost:5173 (the frontend).
- Default port: 3001.

Quality
- Task looks like: { id, title, completed, createdAtMs }.
- Use crypto.randomUUID() when available for id.
- Keep files small and readable. Add GET /health.

Format
- Show terminal commands before running; wait for approval.
- Show short diffs for code changes.

Definition of Done
- All four endpoints work with basic validation.
- Data persists across server restarts via JSON file.
- CORS enabled for localhost:5173.
- `npm run dev` starts a watcher; `npm start` runs plain node.
- Provide quick test examples (curl or REST Client).
