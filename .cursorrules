# Frontend Development Rules

## General Principles
- Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code
- Follow modern JavaScript/TypeScript best practices
- Prioritize accessibility and user experience
- Write self-documenting code with meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility

## Code Style
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces for JavaScript/TypeScript, 4 spaces for Python)
- Use meaningful variable and function names (avoid abbreviations unless widely understood)
- Prefer const over let, avoid var
- Use arrow functions for callbacks and when appropriate
- Use template literals for string concatenation
- Prefer async/await over Promise chains

## React/Component Guidelines (if applicable)
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use TypeScript for type safety when possible
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use meaningful prop names and provide default values when appropriate

## File Organization
- Group related files together
- Use clear, descriptive file names
- Separate concerns (components, utilities, hooks, types)
- Keep files focused and avoid overly large files

## Testing
- Write tests for critical functionality
- Keep tests simple and focused
- Use descriptive test names

## Performance
- Optimize images and assets
- Use lazy loading when appropriate
- Minimize bundle size
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders

## Security
- Sanitize user inputs
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Follow OWASP security best practices
- Never commit API keys or secrets

## Git
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Use conventional commit format when possible

## Documentation
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Keep README up to date
- Document API endpoints and data structures
- Explain "why" not just "what" in comments

Scope/stack:
- React + TypeScript (Vite). No backend.
- Do work in small, safe diffs and show me a brief summary each time.
- Ask for confirmation before running terminal commands.

MVP capabilities:
- Add a task (title). Newest tasks appear at the top.
- Toggle completed (clear visual change).
- Delete a task.
- Persist tasks to localStorage (survive page refresh).
- Simple filters: All / Active / Completed with updating counts.

UX vibe:
- Clean, modern, centered card ~600px wide (responsive on small screens).
- Pleasant spacing/typography. Subtle gradient background (animation optional).
- Optional: checkbox colors—red when unchecked, green with a white ✓ when checked (override default browser styles).

Quality:
- Use a small typed Task model (id, title, completed, createdAt in ms) and a helper to create one with a trimmed title + unique id (crypto.randomUUID when available).
- Keep components small and readable. Avoid heavy state libraries.
- Keep naming consistent (Task/TaskItem/TaskInput). No backend.

Behavior:
- Prefer minimal changes to achieve outcomes.
- If something is ambiguous, propose a sensible default and proceed after I confirm.

Deliverables:
- A runnable project (npm run dev) with the MVP working as described.
- Short diffs for each change; I will approve.
